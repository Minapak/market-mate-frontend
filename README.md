### Key Technical Implementations

#### AI Matching Service
```dart
class AIMatchingProvider extends StateNotifier<MatchingState> {
  Future<List<ExpertModel>> getRecommendations({
    required String userUUID,
    required MatchingCriteria criteria,
  }) async {
    final response = await _repository.getMatches(
      userVector: await _generateUserVector(userUUID),
      preferences: criteria,
    );
    
    return response.data
        .map((json) => ExpertModel.fromJson(json))
        .toList();
  }
  
  Future<MatchingScore> calculateCompatibility(
    UserProfile user,
    ExpertModel expert,
  ) async {
    // Vector similarity calculation with weighted factors
    final locationScore = _calculateLocationScore(user.location, expert.location);
    final expertiseScore = _calculateExpertiseMatch(user.goals, expert.skills);
    final availabilityScore = _checkScheduleCompatibility(user.schedule, expert.availability);
    
    return MatchingScore(
      overall: (locationScore * 0.3 + expertiseScore * 0.5 + availabilityScore * 0.2),
      breakdown: {
        'location': locationScore,
        'expertise': expertiseScore,
        'availability': availabilityScore,
      },
    );
  }
}
```

#### Repository Pattern with Error Handling
```dart
@RestApi()
abstract class MatchingRepository {
  factory MatchingRepository(Dio dio, {String baseUrl}) = _MatchingRepository;

  @GET('/{id}/matchings')
  Future<ResponseModel<Pagination<MatchingModel>>> getMatchings({
    @Path() required String id,
    @Queries() BasicPaginationParams? params,
  });

  @POST('/users/matchings')
  Future<ResponseModel<MatchingModel>> createMatching({
    @Body() required CreateMatchingModel data,
  });
}

class MatchingRepositoryImpl extends MatchingRepository {
  @override
  Future<ResponseModel<Pagination<MatchingModel>>> getMatchings({
    required String id,
    BasicPaginationParams? params,
  }) async {
    try {
      final response = await super.getMatchings(id: id, params: params);
      return response;
    } catch (e) {
      if (e is DioError) {
        throw NetworkException.fromDioError(e);
      }
      throw UnknownException(e.toString());
    }
  }
}
```
